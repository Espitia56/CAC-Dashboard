# CAC-Dashboard
Here is the project that I am working on. I have included my server.R and ui.R files, my dataset, as well as a short video going through my app and explaining the issue that I am having.

Users should be able to upload a dataset like the sample I included and filter that dataset through the datatable. I can get the datatable to filter with hard coded data, but it doesn't work when I try to filter with reactive data that is uploaded.
